## rationale
Every year, nearly 20,000 people die from brain tumors. As such, early detection of these brain tumors is imperative for improving chances of successful treatment and patient survival. However, the process of analyzing MRI images of the brain can be considerably time consuming, as it requires precise, detail-oriented, and sustained focus to ensure that the diagnosis is correct. The process is further impeded given the growing shortage of radiologists, or trained doctors who have experience in interpreting and analyzing MRI images. As such, this creates a pressing issue in healthcare systems, where timely diagnosis is critical.

## specs & metrics
This project develops a deep learning model using PyTorch and EfficientNet-B2 to classify MRI brain scans as 'meningioma,' 'pituitary,' 'glioma,' or 'no tumor.' Trained on over 7,000 MRI images from Kaggle and optimized with hyperparameter tuning, the model improved from an initial 24% accuracy to an average of 98% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.98 across all four classes. The model was trained on Google Colab using an NVIDIA A100 GPU, with data augmentation techniques applied to enhance generalization.

## implications & future research
AI advancements in medical imaging can exceptionally decrease the margin of human error, and observe subtle abnormalities in MRI scans, which may otherwise be imperceivable. If implemented in hospital and medical settings, this model enables earlier, more accurate detection of brain tumors, leading to the potential of saving more lives, improving patients' quality of life, and ultimately placing less strain on radiologists. Furthermore, this model can also be implemented in research, particularly in neuroscience, potentially facilitating in finding a direct link between brain tumors and neurological functions and disorders, expediting scientific breakthroughs and our understanding of the brain. In the future, I plan to explore more adjustments within the model’s architecture - such as the addition of convolutional layers or different state-of-the-art transfer learning models - to see if I could further optimize the model’s performance. Additionally, I could enhance the model's classification by identifying the specific tumor subclass type, increasing diagnostic precision. To make the process of using this model easier, I could also implement a feature in which the tumor, if found, is segmented within the MRI image, providing a visual representation of the tumor's location. This future iteration of my model may require work with a radiologist or a hospital/medical research institute, in providing comprehensive, real-world MRI images and further assistance in this model's development.
